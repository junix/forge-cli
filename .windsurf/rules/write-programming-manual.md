Write a comprehensive README.mdx file that serves as a module navigator and programming manual for my Python codebase. The document should be optimized for developers and AI code assistants who will use these classes and interfaces.

Only analyze and document the code located in the same directory as this README.mdx file and its subdirectories. Ignore any code outside this directory structure.

Please include the following sections:

1. **Project Overview** - A brief introduction to the project's purpose and functionality.

2. **Installation** - Clear instructions for installing the project and its dependencies.

3. **Module Structure** - A hierarchical breakdown of the codebase organization, showing the relationship between modules within this directory.

4. **Key Components** - For each major class/interface in this directory:
   - Purpose and responsibility
   - Core functionality
   - Usage examples with basic code snippets
   - Important methods/properties with parameter details
   - Common patterns for extending/implementing

5. **API Reference** - Organized by module, including:
   - Class/function signatures
   - Parameter descriptions
   - Return value specifications
   - Exception details

6. **Common Usage Patterns** - Examples of typical workflows using the components together.

7. **Advanced Usage** - More complex integration examples and customization options.

8. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and their solutions.

Format the document with clear Markdown headings, code blocks for examples, and tables where appropriate. Include inline code references using backticks. Optimize the document structure for quick navigation and reference lookup.

The README should be technically precise without being unnecessarily verbose. Focus on what developers need to know to effectively use the codebase rather than implementation details.
