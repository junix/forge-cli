### Chat and User Experience (ADR-012, ADR-013)

**ADR-012: Chat-First Architecture Migration**

- Prioritizes chat mode as primary user interface
- Establishes conversation state management
- Defines multi-turn interaction patterns

**ADR-013: Modular Chat Command System**

- Implements extensible command system for chat mode
- Defines command registration and execution patterns
- Establishes 13+ built-in commands with auto-completion

### Configuration and Rendering (ADR-014 to ADR-016)

**ADR-014: Configuration System Refactoring**

- Modernizes configuration management with Pydantic
- Establishes environment variable integration
- Defines configuration validation and defaults

**ADR-015: Modular Tool Renderer Architecture**

- Designs pluggable tool-specific renderers
- Establishes renderer registration and selection
- Enables customizable tool output formatting

**ADR-016: Simplified Tool Renderer Architecture**

- Simplifies the modular renderer approach
- Reduces complexity while maintaining flexibility
- Optimizes for common use cases

## ADR Format and Standards

### Standard ADR Structure

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: Title

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
- Background information
- Problem statement
- Constraints and requirements

## Decision
- What was decided
- Why this approach was chosen
- Alternative approaches considered

## Consequences
- Positive outcomes
- Negative trade-offs
- Implementation requirements
```

### Status Definitions

- **Proposed**: Under consideration, not yet implemented
- **Accepted**: Approved and implemented
- **Deprecated**: No longer recommended, superseded by newer approach
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a specific newer ADR

## Key Architectural Themes

### Type Safety First

Multiple ADRs (007, 010, 011) establish comprehensive type safety:

- Pydantic models for all data structures
- TypeGuard functions for safe type narrowing
- Elimination of `Any` types and defensive programming

### Snapshot-Based Architecture

ADRs 004 and 008 establish the current snapshot-based approach:

- Response snapshots instead of complex event handling
- Simplified state management
- Improved reliability and testability

### Modular Design

ADRs 013, 015, 016 emphasize modularity:

- Pluggable components for extensibility
- Clear separation of concerns
- Registry patterns for component management

### User Experience Focus

ADRs 001, 005, 012 prioritize user experience:

- Intuitive command-line interface
- Rich interactive chat mode
- Comprehensive help and documentation

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

When making architectural decisions:

1. **Read Relevant ADRs**: Understand existing decisions before proposing changes
2. **Follow Established Patterns**: Use patterns from accepted ADRs
3. **Document New Decisions**: Create new ADRs for significant changes
4. **Update Status**: Mark ADRs as deprecated when superseded

### For Contributors

When contributing to the project:

1. **Understand Current Architecture**: Review ADRs 008, 010, 011 for current state
2. **Follow Type Safety**: Implement ADR-007 and ADR-010 patterns
3. **Use V3 Display**: Follow ADR-008 for display components
4. **Extend Chat System**: Use ADR-013 patterns for new chat commands

## ADR Lifecycle

### Creating New ADRs

1. **Identify Need**: Significant architectural decision required
2. **Research Context**: Understand current state and constraints
3. **Propose Solution**: Draft ADR with context, decision, consequences
4. **Review Process**: Team review and discussion
5. **Accept/Reject**: Final decision and status update
6. **Implement**: Code changes following ADR guidance

### Maintaining ADRs

1. **Regular Review**: Periodic assessment of ADR relevance
2. **Status Updates**: Mark deprecated or superseded ADRs
3. **Cross-References**: Link related ADRs and update references
4. **Implementation Tracking**: Ensure code matches ADR decisions

## Related Documentation

- **Main Project Documentation** (`/CLAUDE.md`) - Overall architecture overview
- **API Reference** (`../api_reference/`) - Implementation details
- **Source Code** (`../../src/`) - ADR implementations
- **Historical Documentation** (`../historical/`) - Deprecated feature records

## Best Practices

### Writing ADRs

1. **Be Specific**: Include concrete examples and code snippets
2. **Explain Rationale**: Clearly state why decisions were made
3. **Consider Alternatives**: Document options that were rejected
4. **Think Long-term**: Consider maintenance and evolution implications
5. **Update Cross-References**: Link to related ADRs and documentation

### Using ADRs

1. **Start Here**: Read ADRs before making architectural changes
2. **Follow Patterns**: Implement established patterns consistently
3. **Question Outdated Decisions**: Propose updates when context changes
4. **Document Deviations**: Create new ADRs when departing from established patterns

The ADR directory serves as the architectural memory of the Forge CLI project, ensuring that design decisions are transparent, well-reasoned, and accessible to all contributors.
